--  This package contains the input routines used for reading the
--  input source file. The actual I/O routines are in OS_Interface,
--  with this module containing only the system independent processing.

--  General Note: throughout the compiler, we use the term line or source
--  line to refer to a physical line in the source, terminated by the end of
--  physical line sequence.

--  There are two distinct concepts of line terminator in GNAT

--    A logical line terminator is what corresponds to the "end of a line" as
--    described in RM 2.2 (13). Any of the characters FF, LF, CR or VT or any
--    wide character that is a Line or Paragraph Separator acts as an end of
--    logical line in this sense, and it is essentially irrelevant whether one
--    or more appears in sequence (since if a sequence of such characters is
--    regarded as separate ends of line, then the intervening logical lines
--    are null in any case).

--    A physical line terminator is a sequence of format effectors that is
--    treated as ending a physical line. Physical lines have no Ada semantic
--    significance, but they are significant for error reporting purposes,
--    since errors are identified by line and column location.

--  In GNAT, a physical line is ended by any of the sequences LF, CR/LF, or
--  CR. LF is used in typical Unix systems, CR/LF in DOS systems, and CR
--  alone in System 7. In addition, we recognize any of these sequences in
--  any of the operating systems, for better behavior in treating foreign
--  files (e.g. a Unix file with LF terminators transferred to a DOS system).
--  Finally, wide character codes in categories Separator, Line and Separator,
--  Paragraph are considered to be physical line terminators.

   --  and this proved to be a significant source of inefficiency. We then
   --  switched to using a table with a start point followed by a serial
   --  search. Now we make sure source buffers are on a reasonable boundary
   --  (see Types.Source_Align), and we can just use a direct look up in the
   --  following table.

   --  Note that this array is pretty large, but in most operating systems
   --  it will not be allocated in physical memory unless it is actually used.

   function Get_Line_Number
     (P : Source_Ptr) return Line_Number;
   --  The line number of the specified source position is obtained by
   --  doing a binary search on the source positions in the lines table

   --  Return file table index of file identified by given source pointer

   function Num_Source_Lines (S : Source_File_Index) return Nat;
   --  Returns the number of source lines (this is equivalent to reading

   procedure Skip_Wide (S : Source_Buffer_Ptr; P : in out Source_Ptr);
   --  Similar to the above procedure, but operates on a source buffer
   --  instead of a string, with P being a Source_Ptr referencing the
   --  contents of the source buffer.

   -----------------------
   -- Checksum Handling --
   -----------------------

   --  As a source file is scanned, a checksum is computed by taking all the
   --  non-blank characters in the file, excluding comment characters, the
   --  minus-minus sequence starting a comment, and all control characters
   --  except ESC.

   --  The checksum algorithm used is the standard CRC-32 algorithm, as
   --  implemented by System.CRC32, except that we do not bother with the
   --  final XOR with all 1 bits.

   --  This algorithm ensures that the checksum includes all semantically
   --  significant aspects of the program represented by the source file,
   --  but is insensitive to layout, presence or contents of comments, wide
   --  character representation method, or casing conventions outside strings.

   --  Scans.Checksum is initialized appropriately at the start of scanning
   --  a file, and copied into the Source_Checksum field of the file table
   --  entry when the end of file is encountered.

   Internal_Source : aliased Source_Buffer (1 .. 81);
   --  This buffer is used internally in the compiler when the lexical analyzer
   --  is used to scan a string from within the compiler. The procedure is to
   --  establish Internal_Source_Ptr as the value of Source, set the string to
   --  be scanned, appropriately terminated, in this buffer, and set Scan_Ptr
   --  to point to the start of the buffer. It is a fatal error if the scanner
   --  signals an error while scanning a token in this internal buffer.

   procedure Reset_First;

   function Source_File_Is_Subunit (X : Source_File_Index) return Boolean;
   --  This function determines if a source file represents a subunit. It works
   --  by scanning for the first compilation unit token, and returning True if
   --  it is the token SEPARATE. It will return False otherwise, meaning that
   --  the file cannot possibly be a legal subunit. This function does NOT do a
   --  complete parse of the file, or build a tree. It is used in gnatmake and
   --  gprbuild to decide if a body without a spec in a project file needs to
   --  be compiled or not. Returns False if X = No_Source_File.

   --  Check if the current source starts with a BOM. Scan_Ptr needs to be at
   --  the start of the current source. If the current source starts with a
   --  recognized BOM, then some flags such as Wide_Character_Encoding_Method
   --  are set accordingly, and the Scan_Ptr on return points past this BOM.
