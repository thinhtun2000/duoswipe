--  This package contains the routines to output error messages and the scanner
--  for the project files. It replaces Errout and Scn. It is not dependent on
--  the GNAT tree packages (Atree, Sinfo, ...). It uses exactly the same global
--  variables as Errout, located in package Err_Vars. Like Errout, it also uses
--  the common variables and routines in package Erroutc.
--
--  Parameters are set through Err_Vars.Error_Msg_File_* or
--  Err_Vars.Error_Msg_Name_*, and replaced automatically in the messages
--  ("{{" for files, "%%" for names).
--
--  However, in this package you can configure the error messages to be sent
--  to your own callback by setting Report_Error in the flags. This ensures
--  that applications can control where error messages are displayed.
