   --  happened while parsing the project itself (i.e. creating the tree),

   --
   --  If Config_File_Name is No_Configuration_File, then no configuration
   --  project file is parsed. Normally, in this case On_Load_Config is not

   --  case. Implicit_Project is set to True when a tool such as gprbuild is
   --  invoked without a project file and is using an implicit project file
   --  that is virtually in the current working directory, but is physically
   --  in another directory.
   --
   --  If specified, On_New_Tree_Loaded is called after each aggregated project
   --  has been processed succesfully.
